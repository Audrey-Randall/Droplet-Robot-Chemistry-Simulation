# Droplet-Robot-Chemistry-Simulation 

Please note that the updated versions of this code have moved to a forked branch of cu-droplet. This is old code.

This code is intended to create a tool to teach basic chemistry out of Correl Lab's "Droplet" robots, which were created by John Kligner. Droplets are small, vaguely hemispherical robots that can move, light up in various colors, make simple sounds, and communicate with one another via IR. For more information, see https://github.com/correlllab/cu-droplet. 

At the moment, each Droplet represents an atom. This simulation will show which bonds will form between which atoms. Further down the road, I intend it to simulate much more complex environments and reactions, and I will update this readme when that starts happening.
